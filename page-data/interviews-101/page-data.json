It goes with the following syntax: Hi, I am -name- studying -degree and university-. I also do -extracurricular activities, interesting projects and fun stuff- and I recently started my own blog.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Why do you want to work for us?</li>\n<li>What are some things/extracurricular activities you have done outside of university?</li>\n<li>What will you bring to this role/to our company? Also framed as:</li>\n<li>As you know, this is a very competitive role. What are some things that make you an ideal candidate for this role (and what will you bring to this company)?</li>\n<li>What is your weakness? / Can you tell me a weakness of yours?</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Technical Questions</h3>\n<p>Here are some questions based on Computer Science, Software Development and Artificial Intelligence…</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Can you tell me your favourite/most written programming language?</li>\n<li>What is Machine Learning? followed by 2.1 What algorithms have you used for machine learning?</li>\n<li>Can you explain some characteristics of OOP (Object Oriented Programming)?</li>\n<li>Can you take me through some of the technologies you used in some projects of yours?</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Some fun and interesting questions</h3>\n<p>Here are some questions I really enjoyed answering and thinking about.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Talking about project -> follow up: What do you regret about this project?</li>\n<li>If you were a dinosaur, which one would you be and why?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And that’s all for now.
