Along with this I also attended SOT’s Mock Interviews event to groom me well for speed interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviews can be daunting and nerve wrecking! but after attending these two events, I realised that there’s some common questions asked by many employers with a range of questions, so here’s a few of them (with my answers for some of them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common Questions&lt;/strong&gt;
Here’s the top 5 commonly asked questions during an interview or a speed interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So can tell me a bit about yourself?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well…this is not a question but it is how most interviews start and this gives the interviewer a chance to know you better and ask some follow up questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My answer:&lt;/em&gt; I just use my elevator pitch for this question. It goes with the following syntax: Hi, I am -name- studying -degree and university-. I also do -extracurricular activities, interesting projects and fun stuff- and I recently started my own blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do you want to work for us?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some things/extracurricular activities you have done outside of university?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What will you bring to this role/to our company?
Also framed as:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you know, this is a very competitive role. What are some things that make you an ideal candidate for this role (and what will you bring to this company)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your weakness? / Can you tell me a weakness of yours?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Questions&lt;/strong&gt;
Here are some questions based on Computer Science, Software Development and Artificial Intelligence…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you tell me your favourite/most written programming language? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is Machine Learning?
followed by
2.1 What algorithms have you used for machine learning?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you explain some characteristics of OOP (Object Oriented Programming)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you take me through some of the technologies you used in some projects of yours?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some really interesting and fun questions&lt;/strong&gt;
Here are some questions I really enjoyed answering and thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Talking about project&lt;/em&gt; -&gt; follow up: What do you regret about this project?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you were a dinosaur, which one would you be and why?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we kick off, here’s rubberduck’s motto :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge yourself!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rubberduck, 2019.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always remember this while reading the blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First off, introductions.&lt;/strong&gt; Hello there, I’m rubberduck! A second year Comp Sci student in New Zealand. Nice to meet you, &amp;#x3C;&lt;em&gt;your-name-here&lt;/em&gt;&gt; and welcome to my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/djRJNZqj508sE/giphy.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Hello There&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these blogs I talk about my experience with technologies, mostly self learnt. Both academic studies and the industry teach me something valuable but the best way for anyone working in technology to learn something is to learn everything by themselves! This took me out to the internet to learn a lot more about software and on the blog I’ll reproduce some of my learnings for anyone and everyone out there to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/JIX9t2j0ZTN9S/giphy.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Tech Cat&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of everything I do right now is to &lt;strong&gt;challenge myself to become better than I was a day ago and constantly keep improving&lt;/strong&gt;. That being said, please take everything I say with a grain of salt as there’s a lot I have to learn as a young padawan in this industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that, I’ll end this first blog. Thank you for reading and see you in the next blog.&lt;/p&gt;
